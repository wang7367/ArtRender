# CSci-4611 Assignment 5:  Art Render
Jake Wang

I attempted the work in all the ranges.

#Work in the "C" range:
I completed the phone.frag fragment shader to correctly calculate per-pixel shading. I used the half-vector method for the specular component.

#Work in the "B" range:
I completed the artsy.frag fragment shader to correctly calculate the per-pixel toon shading.

#Work in the "A" range:
I completed the outline.vert vertex shader to draw a black outline for the silhouette edges of the mesh when rendering in "artsy" mode.
